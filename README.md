# BRIDGES_analysis

All of the current scripts are contained in the "Scripts" folder and are labeled with a leading number specifiying the order in which they are to be executed. The analysis has not been fully developed into a pipeline and so you will have to change the file paths that I hardcoded specific to my computer to reflect your organization. Lastly, some of the scripts are a little outdated, as we haven't been using them in the most recent iterations of the analysis, if I have some extra time, i will try to run through them again to weed those out. 

- 01x files are the most important files for anyone using this moving forward
  - These files are where IC filtering, labeling, and visualization is being done and the part in which most time has been devoted
- The rest of the scripts are regression analyses and data cleaning
  - Feel free to use the rest, but it is very messy because it is overly complicated by the fact as i was trying to make a pipeline that included imputation which never quite cohered. 
- XX and YY are useful for formating and saving data to redcap and other sources
